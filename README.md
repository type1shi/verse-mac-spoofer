![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab93ea87-074b-42ba-8bf4-4147cb4a3dda)


## Overview

Welcome to the **VERSE MAC SPOOFER** repository! This project is a C++ application designed to spoof MAC addresses on Windows systems. Inspired by the VERSE MAC SPOOFER, this replica incorporates various features to enhance functionality and security. 

The tool performs multiple actions, including:
- Spoofing MAC addresses.
- Resetting network settings.
- Performing automatic updates.
- Checking for version updates.
- Anti-debugging measures.

This README will guide you through the features of the application, how it works, and how you can build and run the project on your Windows system.

## Features üõ†Ô∏è

1. **MAC Address Spoofing**: Changes the MAC address of the network adapter.
2. **Network Reset**: Resets network settings and reconfigures ARP settings.
3. **Automatic Updates**: Downloads and updates the application if a new version is available.
4. **Version Checking**: Compares local and remote versions to ensure you are using the latest version.
5. **Anti-Debugging**: Includes measures to prevent debugging and reverse engineering.
6. **Encryption and Decryption**: Uses encryption for sensitive data and configurations.

## Building the Project üî®

Follow these detailed steps to build the VERSE MAC SPOOFER on your Windows system:

### Prerequisites

1. **Visual Studio**: Ensure you have Visual Studio installed (2019 or later recommended).
2. **Windows SDK**: Required for Windows-specific APIs.
3. **Dependencies**: `WinINet` and `Urlmon` libraries.

### Step-by-Step Build Guide

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/type1shi/verse-mac-spoofer.git
   cd verse-mac-spoofer
   ```

2. **Open Visual Studio**:
   - Launch Visual Studio.
   - Open the solution file (`.sln`) in the repository. If there is no solution file, create a new C++ project and add all `.cpp` and header files.

3. **Configure Project Properties**:
   - Right-click on the project in the Solution Explorer and select **Properties**.
   - Go to **Configuration Properties** -> **VC++ Directories**.
   - Add the paths to any additional libraries you might need.
   - Go to **Configuration Properties** -> **Linker** -> **Input**.
   - Add `wininet.lib` and `urlmon.lib` to the **Additional Dependencies** field.

4. **Add Dependencies**:
   - Ensure that you have the required libraries (`WinINet`, `Urlmon`) linked in your project settings.
   - You might need to install additional libraries or SDKs if they are not present on your system.

5. **Build the Project**:
   - Go to **Build** -> **Build Solution** or press `Ctrl+Shift+B`.
   - Resolve any compilation errors by referring to the error messages in the Output window.

6. **Run the Application**:
   - After building successfully, run the application directly from Visual Studio or navigate to the output directory and execute the compiled `.exe` file.

## How It Works üß©

### Core Components

1. **MAC Address Spoofing**:
   - The `spoofMAC` function executes a batch script (`MAC.bat`) that contains commands to change the MAC address.
   - Ensure `MAC.bat` exists in `C:\Windows\` or modify the path accordingly.

2. **Network Reset**:
   - The `resetNetworkAndConfigureARP` function resets various network settings and reconfigures ARP settings to ensure a clean network state.

3. **Automatic Updates**:
   - The `auto_update` function checks for updates and replaces the current executable if a newer version is found.
   - Update URL and download link are specified in the `instr` function.

4. **Version Checking**:
   - The `instr` function retrieves the latest version number and compares it with the current version.
   - If an update is available, it downloads the new version and replaces the old one.

5. **Encryption/Decryption**:
   - Encryption utilities from `easencryptprov.h` are used to protect sensitive data.
   - Keys and URLs are encrypted for added security.

6. **Anti-Debugging**:
   - Basic anti-debugging techniques are implemented to prevent reverse engineering.

### Example Usage

1. **Start the Application**:
   - Open a command prompt with administrator privileges.
   - Navigate to the directory containing the compiled executable.
   - Run the application using: `verse-mac-spoofer.exe`.

2. **Insert License Key**:
   - When prompted, insert your license key to activate the application.

3. **Wait for Completion**:
   - The application will perform MAC spoofing, reset network settings, and ensure you are running the latest version.

## Troubleshooting üõ†Ô∏è

- **Compilation Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are properly linked and installed.
- **Runtime Errors**: Verify the paths to scripts and files used in the application.
- **Network Issues**: Make sure you are running the application with administrator privileges.
